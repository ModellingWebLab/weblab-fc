# Finds cell model steady state at 0.25Hz pacing.

documentation {
# Steady State action potential evaluation

This protocol implements steady pacing for cardiac electrophysiology cell models, and produces
the action potential at 0.25Hz. Note that it is a really simple (3 line) protocol definition, that 
just imports SteadyStateRunner.txt and changes one of its inputs.

##Parameters:

* **pacing\_period**  The pacing period in milliseconds overridden to evaluate at 4000ms instead of the default of 1000ms.

}

import "SteadyStateRunner.txt" {
    pacing_period = 4000  # ms    
}
