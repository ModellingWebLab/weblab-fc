# Finds cell model steady state at 2Hz pacing.

# Steady State action potential evaluation

This protocol implements steady pacing for cardiac electrophysiology cell models, and produces
the action potential at 2Hz. Note that it is a really simple (3 line) protocol definition, that 
just imports SteadyStateRunner.txt and changes one of its inputs.

##Parameters:

* **pacing\_period**  The pacing period in milliseconds overridden to evaluate at 500ms instead of the default of 1000ms.

}

import "SteadyStateRunner.txt" {
    pacing_period = 500  # ms    
}
