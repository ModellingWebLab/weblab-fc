These cellML files have been downloaded from Alan/Penny/Gary's repository of annotated cellML files as of r72 of that repository.

They are mostly the excitable models that are packaged with COR.

models which are not called *.cellml, for example *.cellml_invalid, will not currently convert properly for some reason.
