These cellML files have been downloaded from Alan/Penny/Gary's repository of
annotated cellML files as of r72 of that repository.

They are mostly the excitable models that are packaged with COR.

All the *.cellml files directly in this folder are used by the main
long-running protocol tests, and results compared with historic data, to
ensure there are no regressions in functionality.

Models which are not called *.cellml, for example *.cellml_invalid, did not
convert properly for some reason when they were last checked.  They have not
necessarily been tried with the latest code version.

Models within the not_run subfolder do convert correctly, but are not run
automatically by the main tests.
