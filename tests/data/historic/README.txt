These results files originated in order to ensure reproducibility of the
paper http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.06.003 from revision
12588.  The subset corresponding to the ICaL and S1S2 protocols still serve
this purpose, although new models have been added and some minor alterations
made since the publication.  See 
https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/log/projects/FunctionalCuration/test/data/historic?mode=follow_copy
for a complete list of changes, and
https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/PaperTutorials/FunctionalCuration/FunctionalCuration
for a discussion of the reasons for changes.

Results from additional protocols have since been added, in order to give
greater assurance about the stability of the functional curation software,
and verify reproducibility of many of the results shown on the cardiac Web
Lab (https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/FunctionalCuration/db.html) even with
changes in the underlying software.
